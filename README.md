# Notebook-with-SQL-Command
We've seen that notebooks can display basic objects such as numbers and strings. But notebooks also support and display the outputs of SQL commands! Using an open source Jupyter extension called ipython-sql, we can connect to a database and issue SQL commands within our notebook. For example, we can connect to a PostgreSQL database that has a table that contains country data, then inspect the first three rows of the table by putting %%sql ahead of the SQL commands (more on the meaning of %% later).  It's estimated that on average 256 children were born every minute in 2016. The code cell below calculates how many children were born on average on a day.

# Result
The result will be displayed directly in the notebook. You could use a notebook as a simple calculator. For example, it's estimated that on average 256 children were born every minute in 2016. The code cell below calculates how many children were born on average on a day.
